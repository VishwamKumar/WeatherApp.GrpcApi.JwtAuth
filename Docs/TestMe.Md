# WeatherApp Jwt Auth TestMe

## How To Test
1. Use PostMan
2. Create a request with POST, e.g. URL like
  https://localhost:7026/api/Auth/Login
  In the body, send the following 
 {
    "UserName":"TestUser1",
    "Password":"TestPassword1"
  }

 You will get a token value if authentication is successful.

    {
      "days": 4
    }

4. Invoke the call, you should receive a reponse in JSON format if token is valid else error
